# Roderick-Dev-Site

## Description

Motivation for this project is to have an active showcase for the skills I have learned during this course. While actively updating it I get practice to put lessons to use. I believe this would easily show what I am able to do to potential employers and peers. At the time of this project I have learned HTML, CSS and Github.
